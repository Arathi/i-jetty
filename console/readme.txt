Console WebApp
=============

This webapp is a demonstration of the integration of servlet technology
with Android APIs.

When deployed on i-jetty, it exposes information and media stored on your
phone via the network. This means that you can remotely manage your phone,
and also retrieve images, videos and audio files via your everyday desktop
browser.

You can find more information at the i-jetty project at:

Build Instructions
==================

1) mvn clean install


This will build both the webapp, and an Android application that will
install it to i-jetty.
